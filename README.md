# Templ + HTMX + Air Practice

## Introduction

I never really used Templ, Air, or HTMX before, so I decided to practice with them. I created a simple web application that uses Templ for templating, Air for serving the application, and HTMX for client-side routing and dynamic content loading.

## Goal

I want to use these technologies to create a much larger web app in the future, but for now I need to learn how to use them effectively.
